tcp-socket
==========

This shim brings [Mozilla-flavored](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/TCP_Socket) version of the [Raw Socket API](http://www.w3.org/TR/raw-sockets/) to node.js, Chromium apps, Windows/WP 8 apps, and websockets (via socket.io). Its purpose is to enable apps to use the same codebase in Firefox OS, Chrome OS, and on the server.

# Usage

Include the source files and `forge` in your markup. It will attach itself to the navigator object.

    <script src="forge.min.js"></script>
    <script src="emailjs-tcp-socket-tls.js"></script>
    <script src="emailjs-tcp-socket.js"></script>

    // creates a TCP socket
    var tcp = navigator.TCPSocket.open('127.0.0.1', 8000);

    // creates a TLS socket
    var tls = navigator.TCPSocket.open('127.0.0.1', 9000, {
        useSecureTransport: true,
        ca: 'insert PEM-formatted cert here' // certificate pinning
    });

**A note on node-webkit and electron**:

Hybrid native platforms like NW.js (n√©e node-webkit) and electron will be identified via `typeof process !== 'undefined'`. AMD is not supported for these platforms.

**A note on TLS**: Native TLS support is flaky throughout the platforms. If you want to use TLS on a platform that does not natively provide it, we fall back to [forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) for TLS, and you must provide a certificate for pinning! Please consult the [forge project page](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) for examples how to make forge available in your application and/or have a look at the example in this repository.

The following platforms support TLS natively:

* node.js
* Desktop Chrome Apps on Chrome M38+ with TLS connection (native tls is broken for STARTTLS :( )
* Windows StreamSocket

The following implementations use forge as a TLS shim:

* WebSockets
* Chrome Apps with STARTTLS and Mobile Chrome Apps built with [cca](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps) (chrome.sockets.tcp.secure is broken)

**Use of web workers**: If you are on a platform where we fall back to forge for TLS, we can spin up a Web Worker to handle the TLS-related computation. To do this, you need to **browserify** `tcp-socket-tls-worker.js`. Please keep in mind that `forge.min.js` and the browserified version of `tcp-socket-tls-worker.js` **must** in the same folder! If you use a different path relative to your html file, you can provide it this file when you fire up the socket. **If tlsWorkerPath is undefined, no Web Worker will be started and the TLS-relatid computation will happen on the main thread!**

    // creates a TLS socket with a specific TLS worker path
    var tls = navigator.TCPSocket.open('127.0.0.1', 9000, {
        useSecureTransport: true,
        tlsWorkerPath: 'relative/path/to/tcp-socket-tls-worker.js'
    });

On a platform where we fall back to forge for TLS, you can either supply the socket with a certificate, or use a trust-on-first-use based approach, where the socket is accepted in the first try and you will receive a callback with the certificate. Use this certificate in subsequent interactions with this host. Host authenticity is evaluated based on their Common Name (or SubjectAltNames) and the certificate's public key fingerprint.

    var tls = navigator.TCPSocket.open('127.0.0.1', 9000, {
        useSecureTransport: true
    });

    tls.oncert = function(pemEncodedCertificate) {
        // do something useful with the certificate, e.g.
        // store it and reuse it on a trust-on-first-use basis
    };

Here's how the TLS socket will behave when presented with a server certificate:

* If the server does not present a certificate, it rejects the connection
* If the server presents a certificate with wrong/missing CN and/or wrong/missing SANs, it rejects the connection
* If no certificate was pinned, it calls .oncert() with the pem-encoded certificate and accepts the connection
* If a certificate was pinned, but the server presents another certificate (according to the public key fingerprint), it calls .oncert() to inform you about changes, but rejects the connection
* If a certificate was pinned and the server certificate's public key fingerprint matches the pinned certificate, the connection is accepted. .oncert will **not** be called in this case!

**A note on STARTTLS**: `upgrateToSecure()` will return immediately. If the TLS negotiation fails, the socket will throw an error and close. The socket buffers writes that occur in the meantime and writes the data out altogether when the TLS handshake is done. If said behavior is a problem in your protocol, please open an issue and/or submit a PR.

For everything else, see the [Mozilla TCPSocket API Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TCPSocket).

**A note on WebSockets**: Run the websocket proxy (socket.io + express) to use TCPSocket straight from the browser.

WebSocket shim adds a new configuration object `ws` to TCPSocket.open

  * **url** is the url for the WebSocket proxy server (defaults to '/')
  * **options** are [Socket.io options](http://socket.io/docs/client-api/#io(url:string,-opts:object):socket)

    var socket = TCPSocket.open('127.0.0.1', 9000, {
        ...
        ws: {
            url: 'http://localhost:8889',
            options: {
                upgrade: false
            }
        }
    });

To run WebSocket integration tests that connect to `imap.gmail.com:993` run

    NODE_ENV=integration node ws-proxy/server.js

Parallel to that, run

    grunt connect:dev

and open [http://localhost:12345/test/integration/ws/integration.html](http://localhost:12345/test/integration/ws/integration.html) in your browser.

WebSocket integration tests can be run via `grunt ws-integration-test`. They are disabled by default because these do not run correctly under PhantomJS.

To run the integration tests in Chrome:

1) Install `test/integration/chrome/certificate.crt` to your Chrome certificate storage (On Mac OS, that's the keychain)
2) Add `test/integration/chrome` as a packaged app
3) Run `node test/integration/chrome/server.js`
4) Start the Chrome App.
