# UTF-7

UMD module that encodes and decodes JavaScript (Unicode/UCS-2) strings to UTF-7 ASCII strings. It supports two modes: UTF-7 as defined in [RFC 2152](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2152) and Modified UTF-7 as defined by the IMAP standard in [RFC 3501, section 5.1.3](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501#section-5.1.3)

## Usage

    [bower | npm] install emailjs-utf7

### node.js

    var utf7 = require('emailjs-utf7');

### Browser

Require [utf7.js](src/utf7.js) either as a AMD module include it globally in your markup like a regular ```<script>``` (exposes utf7).

### RFC 2152

    var encoded = utf7.encode('Jyväskylä');
    'Jyv+AOQ-skyl+AOQ-' === encoded; // true

    var decoded = utf7.decode(encoded);
    'Jyväskylä' === decoded; // true

By default, `.encode()` only encodes the default characeters defined in RFC 2152. To also encode optional characters, use `.encodeAll()` or specify the characters you want to encode as the second argument to `.encode()`.

### IMAP (RFC 3501)

    var encoded = utf7.imap.encode('"你好" heißt "Hallo"');
    '"&T2BZfQ-" hei&AN8-t "Hallo"' === encoded;

    var decoded = utf7.imap.decode(encoded);
    '"你好" heißt "Hallo"' === decoded;
